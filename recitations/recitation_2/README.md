This recitation focuses around the key concepts of *discrete choice modeling* and how we can leverage Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to improve over traditional baselines, such as the multi-logit model. More concretely, we will be exploring the Alternative-sSpecific Utility functions(ASU)-DNN presented in the [paper](./paper/10.1016@j.trc.2020.01.012.pdf) by Wang et al.
